# Text cleaning script
A simple static HTML page that uses a javascript based script to aid in the transfer of text between different systems. The script is for a very specific use case and is only intended for internal use.

The script uses uses `.replaceAll()` and regex to find commonly replaced strings.

All formatting is done client side in the browser and no HTML-requests are made whatsoever.
